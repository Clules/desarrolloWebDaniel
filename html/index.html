          1.1: What are Neural Networks? Neural networks are a cool blend of
          biology and computer science, inspired by our brain’s setup to tackle
          complicated computing tasks. Essentially, they’re algorithms designed
          to spot patterns and make sense of sensory data, which lets them do a
          ton of stuff like recognizing faces, understanding spoken words,
          making predictions, and understanding natural language.
